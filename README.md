Description: SQL to allow players to learn the initial riding skill and purchase mounts at level one

Instructions: Use level-one-mounts.sql on your world database (script references acore_world) to apply the changes to your world.  A server restart will be required for the changes to take affect.  To revert back to level 20 mounts, use level-twenty-mounts.sql.

These SQL scripts pair very well with the following azerothcore mods:  

1) sql-npc-teleporter: This allows players in starting areas to port to other starting areas.  Some rider trainers are harder to get to than others: https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue#/details/311142327 

1) mod-customlogin: This gives the player exhaulted faction with the 5 main factions on either the alliance or horde side.  This gives players more mount options from the get-go: https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue#/details/189713701
